FIX:

TODO:
- Test operators.
- Add debug messages to the base operations.
- Add help and time operators.
- Implement Grr.
- Implement Imp.
- Implement Tsf.

FUTURE:
Front part:
- Tree-sitter or language server protocol integration.
- Translate markdown (and colors) to ansi in strings.
- Include a wrapper for other interactive shells.
- Scratch paper.
- Seperate buffer for outputs, allowing for navigating and yanking the outputs.
Lang part:
- Make "," follow spec.
- Rust style enum and match, which implies switch case.
- Basically, pattern matching. This applies to variable assignment too.
- Struct and typeclass/trait.
- More string types. E.G. lit string, regex string, whatever.
- Slices, anonymous functions, libraries.
- Compiled version.
- Real generic support.
- Seperate IO operations and non-IO operations. This will allow for better handling of both.
- Make a "Hare" variant. A lazy, probably faster version.
- Proper process handling and pipelining. Might pass process handles around.
- Capturing stdout while letting it print out naturally in `cap`.

NOTES:
Currently, pipe is just eval left and pass it to system and feed out to right process.
Redirect is just eval right, NOT passing it to system, then feed to left process.
