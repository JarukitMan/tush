FIX:
- Tuple-handling in the evaluation module loops
- That issue seems to be in Parse.insert as it seems to just pack everything into one operand if the operator is between things.

TODO:
- Base operations
- Implement (hack) return
- Type equality allowing for Tany to match any type
- Order the operation ranks.

FUTURE:
Front part:
- Fix "," to make it follow spec.
- Tree-sitter or language server protocol integration.
- translating markdown (and colors) to ansi in strings would be banger.
- Include a wrapper for other interactive shells.
- Scratch paper.
Lang part:
- rust style enum and match, which implies switch case.
- struct and typeclass/trait.
- More string types. E.G. lit string, regex string, whatever.
- slices, anonymous functions, libraries.
- Compiled version.
