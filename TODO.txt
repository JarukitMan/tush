FIX:

TODO:
- Order the operation ranks.
- Implement (hack) return, continue, and break.
  - Make the type-checker check for returns
  - Make output type part of the interpret function input,
    so that it can immediately exit when the type matches.
    The top level would be Tany.
    `break` and `return` could be return () and
      ^           ^ do nothing.
      signal the loop to end somehow.
- Base operations
- Map operations to names

FUTURE:
Front part:
- Tree-sitter or language server protocol integration.
- Translate markdown (and colors) to ansi in strings.
- Include a wrapper for other interactive shells.
- Scratch paper.
Lang part:
- Make "," follow spec.
- Rust style enum and match, which implies switch case.
- Struct and typeclass/trait.
- More string types. E.G. lit string, regex string, whatever.
- Slices, anonymous functions, libraries.
- Compiled version.
